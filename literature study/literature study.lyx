Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Web Usage Mining
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Episodes log mining
\emph default
 is a specialized form of 
\emph on
web usage mining
\emph default
, which in turn is a type of 
\emph on
web mining
\emph default
.
 But what is 
\emph on
web mining
\emph default
? According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Web Data Mining"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\series bold
Web mining aims to discover useful information or knowledge from
\series default
 the web hyperlink structure, page content and 
\series bold
usage data
\series default
.
 Although web mining uses many data mining techniques, it is n
\series bold
ot purely an application of traditional data mining due to the hetereogeneity
 and semi-structured or unstructured nature of the web data
\series default
.
 Many new mining tasks and algorithms were invented in the past decade.
 Based on the primary kinds of data used in the mining process, web mining
 tasks can e categorized into three types: web structure mining, web content
 mining and 
\series bold
web usage mining
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web mining process is similar to the traditional data mining process,
 however, there usually is a difference in the data collection step.
 In traditional data mining, the data is often already collected (and stored
 in a data warehouse).
 In the cases of web structure mining and web content mining, collecting
 data can be a large and daunting undertaking.
 Fortunately, in the case of web usage mining, it is fairly simple: most
 web servers keep log files already (e.g.
 Apache server logs).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

And as indicated at the beginning of this section, it is only web usage
 mining that we need, the other types of web mining are irrelevant for this
 thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Web Data Mining"

\end_inset

, web usage mining is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\series bold
Web usage mining
\series default
 refers to the automatic discovery and analysis of patterns in clickstream
 and associated data colected or generated as a result of user interactions
 with web resources on one or more web sites.
 
\series bold
The goal is to capture, model and analyze the behavioral patterns
\series default
 and profiles of users interacting with a web site.
 The 
\series bold
discovered patterns
\series default
 are usually represented as 
\series bold
collections of pages
\series default
, objects, or resources 
\series bold
that are frequently accessed by groups of users with common needs or interests
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Web Usage Mining Versus Episodes Log Mining
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in the context of page loading performance (what this thesis is
 about), typical web server logs are not sufficient: they only capture which
 resources were requested by user agents and some metadata (date and time,
 IP address, referrer, etc.).
 That is by itself not enough information on how the actual page loading
 performance of the browser as perceived by the end user was.
 It only provides sufficient information for other kinds of analysis, such
 as typical navigation paths, popular pages, and so on.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

While that is interesting in itself and 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be useful for suggesting advanced page loading performance improvements
 (e.g.
 preload images of typical next pages in typical navigation paths), it doesn't
 provide enough information to be able to perform page loading performance
 analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's why Episodes was developed.
 As explained earlier 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO
\end_layout

\end_inset

, Episodes records the durations of the various episodes during the loading
 of the page and when the page has finished loading, it sends this information
 to a web server log.
 It does this by means of a specially formatted URL — the URL contains the
 names and durations of the recorded episodes (in order of being recorded
 and occurrence) as a single long GET parameter.
 This GET parameter can then be parsed to easily extract the episodes that
 were recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The additional information that is virtually always included in web server
 log files, such as IP address, date and time and user agent can then be
 used to apply page loading performance analysis: IP addresses can be mapped
 to locations/ISPs to pinpoint bad performance to a specific location/ISP,
 date and time can be used to detect bad performance during specific times
 during the day (indicating overloaded web or application servers) and finally
 the browser and operating system can be used to detect performance issues
 with a specific browser, possibly a specific version of that browser and
 even on a specific operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, of course, any page loading performance issues that are a combination
 of the above can also be detected: page loading performance problems that
 only occur for a specific browser/ISP combination, for example (which might
 be caused by e.g.
 a badly configured web proxy server).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of page loading performance issues that need to be detected automatical
ly are, for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\emph on
http://example.com/
\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Definition of 'Slow'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a subjective quality.
 There are many possible methods for defining 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Here are two examples (which I would like to support both in the implementation
 that will accompany this thesis):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The top 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 percent slowest episodes are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would be configurable by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There's a threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 defined for each episode; durations for this episode higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 would be marked slow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analogously, one could define multiple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

speeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: very slow — slow — acceptable — fast — very fast, for example.
 This would need to come with sane defaults, but should be configurable
 by the user in the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Mining Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall web usage mining process (and therefore Episodes log mining,
 which is merely a specialization) can be seen as a three-stage process.
 Below, I've provided a high-level comparison of the differences between
 web usage mining and Episodes log mining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
data collection and pre-processing
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\bar under
Web usage mining:
\bar default
 this would consist of partitioning the log entries into a set of user transacti
ons.
 In pre-processing, knowledge about the site content or structure, or semantic
 domain knowledge (from the used ontologies) may be used to enhance the
 transaction data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\bar under
Episodes log mining:
\bar default
 here, it is quite different: data collection is not an issue; and pre-processin
g consists of mapping the IP address of each log entry to a location and
 an ISP (if possible), extracting the various episodes from the specially
 formatted URL, normalizing the user agent string, and so on.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\emph on
The data collection has already been implemented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Episodes log mining:
\bar default
 the discovered patterns and statistics are displayed in a tool that provides
 visualizations and automatically makes suggestions as how to solve automaticall
y detected page loading performance issues.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\emph on
This visualization tool will be implemented as part of this master thesis.
 For this, OLAP will be used — see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:OLAP"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneously, this overview of course also gives a high-level idea of
 what the implementation that will accompany this thesis will entail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Evolution over Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- when improvements are implemented, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can become redefined
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- when monitoring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

live page loading performance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one probably only wants to look at the last year, month, week, day, hour
 or fifteen minutes and compare the page loading performance for these periods,
 to verify stability or improvements and detect regressions.
 Compare this to typical data mining, which operates on the entire data
 set.
 Here, we want to apply data mining on subsets.
 And possibly even data mining on a live stream, to monitor the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truly live page loading performance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and possibly show the overall variance, the variance per country, etc.,
 compared to the last year/month/week/day/hour.
 But then when is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the last hour
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 updated? Every hour? Every fifteen minutes? Every minute? Live?

The Attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained before, essentially the goal of this thesis is analyzing Episodes
 log files.
 Each log entry is stored in a format which has been optimized to store
 only the information necessary for Episodes log mining instead of regular
 web usage mining.
 The format is as follows:

In this section, a more in-depth look is given at the various attributes
 in an Episodes log file, what they mean, how they should be generated from
 the fields in each log entry and how they should be used to provide meaningful
 insight into page loading performance issues for the end user.

 Note that the available fields differ slightly from those for typical web
 usage mining (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) and that the semantics may also differ slightly (see the per-field explanation

 However, bots only download the (X)HTML.
 Possibly, they also download the associated resources (CSS, JavaScript,

 it, not because they want to render the page.
 Hence the Episodes JavaScript does not get executed and therefore no log
 entries will appear for bots in the Episodes log file.
 Conclusion: bots are a non-issue for Episodes log mining!

 browser, browser version and user agent.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
New Possibilities by Using Concept Hierarchies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When one uses concept hierarchies in association rule mining, some new possibili
ties open up:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Support counts of items at the lower levels of the hierarchy can be summed
 for their parent items.
 This means that while many low items in the concept hierarchy may have
 a low support count (and thus not meet the minimum support count), their
 parent nodes may have a sufficiently high support count and thus result
 in an association rule, that would not have been found without the use
 of a concept hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
E.g.: both printers and scanners may be sold in limited numbers, but their
 combined sales are summed as computer accessories, and these might be high,
 which would result in an association rule that would otherwise not have
 been found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Applied to Episodes log mining: assume the number of Episodes log entries
 is low for the operating systems Mac OS X 10.4, Mac OS X 10.5 and Mac OS
 X 10.6.
 Hence their support count is low and does not meet the minimum support
 count.
 However, combined they do meet the minimum support count.
 And thus a rule 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

http://example.com/ is slow for visitors that use the operating system Mac
 OS X 10.4
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph on
would not 
\emph default
be found, nor for any other versions of the operating system, but a rule
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

http://example.com/ is slow for visitors that use the operating system Mac
 OS X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 be found.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Similarly, association rules involving items at the lower levels of a concept
 hierarchy can be very specific and may thus be of less interest than rules
 at the higher levels.
 When using a concept hierarchy, it is possible to summarize these very
 specific association rules into more general association rules, making
 the results more easily interpretable and likely also more useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Implementation Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard association rule mining can be adapted to incorporate concept hierarchi
es fairly easily.
 Each transaction 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is replaced with its 
\emph on
extended transaction
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $t'$
\end_inset

, which contains all the items in 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, plus the corresponding ancestors.
 For example, when the user agent string would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.6); .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then the following ancestors would be added: Internet Explorer 6.0, Internet
 Explorer 6, Internet Explorer, Windows XP Service Pack 1 x86, Windows XP
 Service Pack 1, Windows x86, Windows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to this approach, existing association rule mining algorithms such
 as 
\emph on
Apriori
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
FP-growth
\emph default
 can be applied to the extended transactions, to find rules over multiple
 levels of the concept hierarchy.
 While this is obviously trivial to implement, there are also several equally
 obvious limitations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the minimum support count is set too high, then only association rules
 that involve the items at the higher levels are discovered.
 Analogously, if the minimum support count is set too low, then too many
 association rules (many of which may be redundant) will be generated and
 the number of required computations may rise too high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This is in fact a consequent of the previous point: redundant association
 rules may be generated.
 A rule 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 is redundant if a more general rule 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\rightarrow\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 exists, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is an ancestor of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 is an ancestor of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and both rules have similar confidence.
 If confidence differs, then it it's possible that a more specific rule
 occurs with a higher confidence than the general rule.
 This would suggest that while the association exists for the more general
 rule, that it is more pronounced in the more specific rule.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Fortunately, it is easy to eliminate redundant itemsets during frequent
 itemset generation, given that the concept hierarchy is known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because all transactions are increased in size (i.e.
 they're extended with ancestor items), the number of candidate frequent
 item sets and frequent itemsets will also grow.
 Depending on the form of the concept hierarchy, this growth may even be
 exponential.

Discretization: Information Loss

 However, this is not adequate to deal with numerical data directly.

, an alternative mining method is proposed, which discerns itself by not

 They propose a new technique based on well-established statistical studies

 of rank correlation measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They propose to compare attributes by the rank of their values, through
 three new support measures for sets of numerical attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $supp_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, based on Kendall's 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using these new support measures and techniques they've developed to
 combine the mining of sets of numerical attributes with ordinal and categorical
 attributes, it is possible to form association rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In their case, they've applied it to meteorological data, which allowed
 them to discover association rules such as:

Preloading of resources based on typical navigation paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 1: user identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can only know which paths are typical if you can identify the navigation
 of a single user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2: sessionization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
page a as the last viewed page on day 1 and page b as the first viewed page
 on day 2, by the same user, do not form a navigation path, since they occur
 in different sessions.
 Hence sessionization is necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 3: path completion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
pages in the navigation path may be cached in the end user's browser and
 therefore their browser may not make any request at all to the web server,
 and thus it may not show up in the web server log.
 (The solution is path inference by looking at the referrers.) This is true
 for typical web usage mining, but not for Episodes log mining, since Episodes
 also runs on cached pages and thus logs the recorded episodes and thus
 all page loads show up in the logs.
 Hence path completion is a non-issue here (the typical solution, path inference
 through referrers would also not work since the referrer field has a different
 semantic in the context of Episodes logs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to calculate the navigation paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thoughts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When typical navigation paths have been found, they can be exported in a
 simple format, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

path2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (spaces are not allowed in URLs).
 This information can then be used by the web site to automatically preload
 resources on other pages.
 Of course, this could also be done manually, but then it's easy to become
 outdated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three ways a web site can implement this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
crawl the pages in typical navigational paths and detect which resources
 are new in comparison with previous pages in the paths (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resource deltas
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Then load these resources after the page has finished loading.
 Possibly limit to resources 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the CMS has a built-in API to list resources on each page, which would then
 allow for easy detection of resource deltas.
 Then load these resources after the page has finished loading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
simply do the following in JS: download the html of the next page, insert
 it in the current DOM tree but with display:none and all resources on that
 page will get loaded.
 Or: use a hidden iframe.
 Or: use jQuery(window).load(preloadURL) (only works for the same domain,
 even loading a page from a subdomain doesn't work, due to the same origin
 policy of browsers!)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

While very simple to implement, the downside is that the entire HTML will
 be loaded and parsed, and the JS will also execute.
 This also means that this will be counted as a true pageview.
 Episodes will not run again though (it is triggered on specific page load
 events that are not triggered again because in fact the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main page
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has already been loaded).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multidimensional Array
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key motivation for using a multidimensional viewpoint of data is the importanc
e of aggregating data from various perspectives.
 In sales, you might want to find totals for a specific product per year
 and per location for example.
 Or per day.
 Or for all products per location.
 Anything is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To represent this input data as a multidimensional array, two steps are
 necessary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
identification of the dimensions (or 
\emph on
functional attributes
\emph default
); these must be 
\emph on
categorical attributes
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Obviously, any attribute can be transformed into a categorical attribute
 by means of discretization.
 This is also what has been done for the example: the petal length and petal
 width examples have been discretized.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
identification of the attribute that is the focus of the analysis (the 
\emph on
measure attribute
\emph default
) — this attribute is called the 
\emph on
target quantity
\emph default
; this must be a 
\emph on
quantitative attribute
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that it is possible to have multiple target quantities (i.e.
 analyze multiple quantitative attributes simultaneously).
 However, to keep the reasoning straightforward, we will impose a limit
 of a single target quantity.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One could simply analyze each target quantity separately, or apply an arbitrary
 formula to combine multiple quantitative attributes into a single target
 quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dimensions are categorical attributes.
 The values of an attribute serve as the indices into the array for the
 dimension corresponding to that attribute; the size of this dimension is
 equal to the number of different values for this attribute.

Dimensions of a multidimensional array representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the case of the Iris data set (see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:datacube-iris-example"

\end_inset

), there are a single quantitative attribute (count) and 3 categorical attribute
s:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
petal length
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
petal width
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
species type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As already mentioned before, petal length and petal width originally also
 were quantitative attributes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 over the same 3 values: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

medium
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Hence 3 is the size of both the petal length dimension and the petal width
 dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are 3 different species and thus the species type dimension is also
 of size 3.
 Hence there are 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3\times3$
\end_inset

 indices, with 27 corresponding values.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each combination of attribute values (one for each attribute) defines a
 cell in the multidimensional array; each cell contains the value of the
 target quantity.
 The target attribute is a 
\emph on
quantitative
\emph default
 attribute because typically the goal is to look at aggregate 
\emph on
quantities
\emph default
 (total, average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation …; the list can go
 on endlessly when adding domain-specific functions for physics, financial
 analysis, etc.).

Multidimensional array representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are three categorical attributes: petal length, petal width and species
 type.
 There is one quantitative attribute: the corresponding count.
 Since there are three categorical attributes, this can be represented in
 a three-dimensional array.
 See figure

a

aggregates are there, it is not a data cube! (Note that there is for example
 no aggregate count for all flowers by species type, amongst others.) At
 least in OLAP context.
\begin_inset Newline newline

It may be called a

 though: it is just a way to represent a data set — no calculations are

 For the result of the data cube

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As input, the data cube operator accepts a fact table T.
 T has 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 aggregation attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{A_{1}},\text{…},\mathtt{A_{n}}$
\end_inset

 and 1 measure attribute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{M}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(\mathtt{A_{1}},\text{…},\mathtt{A_{n}},\mathtt{M})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation function is applied to the measure attribute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{M}$
\end_inset

, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
SUM()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SQL syntax for the data cube operator is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
SELECT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{A_{1}}$
\end_inset

, …, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{A_{n}}$
\end_inset

, CSUM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
FROM T
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
GROUP BY 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{A_{1}}$
\end_inset

, …, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{A_{n}}$
\end_inset

, SUM(*) AS CSUM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
WITH CUBE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let us consider the semantics behind the above.
 Consider a subset of the aggregation attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{\mathtt{S}}\subseteq\{\mathtt{A_{1}},\text{…},\mathtt{A_{n}}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Define the query 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathtt{S}}$
\end_inset

 as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
SELECT 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{\hat{A}_{1}}$
\end_inset

, …, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{\hat{A}_{n}}$
\end_inset

, SUM(M)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
FROM T
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
GROUP BY S
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathtt{\hat{A}_{i}}=\begin{cases}
\mathtt{A_{i}} & if\,\mathtt{A_{i}}\in\mathtt{S}\\
\mathnormal{\mathbf{\mathtt{ALL}}} & otherwise\end{cases}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(In the above, each 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 value is in fact an alias for a set: the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 values of the attribute over which an aggregate is computed.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathtt{S}}$
\end_inset

 defines aggregation over a specific combination of attributes.
 Then the entire cube is the union of all these 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathtt{S}}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with all possible subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{S}$
\end_inset

), of which there are 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 there are 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset

 subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{S}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 aggregation attributes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the cardinality of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 attributes are 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1},C_{2},\text{…},C_{n}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $cardinality(\mathtt{A_{i}})=C_{i}$
\end_inset

), then the cardinality of the resulting cube relation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod(C_{i}+1)$
\end_inset

.
 The extra value in each attribute domain is the 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 value, which represents the set of values over which the aggregate is computed.

Roll-up

\begin_layout Standard
A roll-up is the aggregation of values 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 a dimension — not across an entire dimension!
\begin_inset Newline newline

Note: this requires that the attribute that is being rolled up can be considered
 hierarchical in some sense, i.e., that it can be viewed with different levels
 of granularity.

Roll-up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since the Iris data set does not contain any hierarchical data, we cannot
 apply roll-up to it.
 So, another example is presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, given sales data with entries for each date, we can 
\emph on
roll up
\emph default
 (aggregate) the data across all dates in a month, resulting in monthly
 sales totals.
 This is aggregation within a dimension; aggregation across a dimension
 would have given us the total of all sales ever recorded.

Continuing on the example for roll-up, a drill-down would for example split
 monthly sales totals into daily sales totals.
 For such drill-downs to be possible, it is of course a necessity that the
 underlying data is sufficiently granular.

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, data is stored in an RDBMS.
 To calculate the above constructs, the 
\family typewriter
GROUP BY
\family default
 operator is necessary.
 This operator partitions the relation into disjoint tuple sets (based on
 one or more attributes that are common amongst the tuples in each tuple
 set) and then aggregates over each set.
 In other words, using the 
\family typewriter
GROUP BY
\family default
 construct allows a table to be created of many aggregate values, 
\emph on
indexed by a set of attributes
\emph default

 It just can't be expressed very

 A SQL statement of the type

Suppose car sales data is being collected in a

 hierarchy, to decrease granularity at each step.

 We now have a roll-up over 3 dimensions, which required the union of 3

Solution to daunting SQL: the data cube operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As should be clear by now, the data cube operator was not absolutely necessary
 in the strictest sense: anything that can be achieved with the data cube
 operator can be achieved without it.
 But thanks to the data cube operator, it is no longer necessary to apply
 the same patterns repeatingly: the necessary SQL becomes much less daunting
 (e.g.
 a 6D cross tabulation would require a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{6}=64$
\end_inset

 way union).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

And because the exact logic behind it is now abstracted away in the SQL
 language syntax, it paved the way for possible future optimizations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support the data cube operator, SQL's 
\family typewriter
SELECT
\family default
-
\family typewriter
GROUP
\family default
-
\family typewriter
BY
\family default
-
\family typewriter
HAVING
\family default
 syntax was extended to support histograms, decorations
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Decorations are columns that do not appear in the GROUP BY list — and that
 are therefore not allowed to be projected (be in the 
\family typewriter
SELECT
\family default
 list) in traditional SQL — but that are functionally dependent on the grouping
 columns.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for more details.
\end_layout

 and the 
\family typewriter
CUBE
\family default
 operator (as well as the 
\family typewriter
ROLLUP
\family default
 operator

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing with the Iris data set (see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:datacube-iris-example"

\end_inset

), a sample query that utilizes the newly introduced data cube operator
 is listed below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},language=SQL,tabsize=4"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

SELECT PetalLength, PetalWidth, SpeciesType, COUNT(*) AS CCount
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

FROM Iris
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

GROUP BY PetalLength,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

         PetalWidth,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

         SpeciesType
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	WITH CUBE;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the semantics behind this query, see the definition in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:OLAP:data-cube:Definition"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be helpful to give you a deeper understanding of 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 values (again, see the definition), in the context of this example.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Each 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 value is in fact an alias for a set: the set over which the aggregate is
 computed.
 In this example, these respective sets are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},language=SQL,tabsize=4"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ALL(speciesType) = {'Setosa', 'Versicolour', 'Virginica'}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},language=SQL,tabsize=4"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ALL(petalLength) = {'low', 'medium', 'high'}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small\ttfamily},language=SQL,tabsize=4"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ALL(petalWidth) = {'low', 'medium', 'high'}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinking of the 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 value as an alias of these sets, makes it easier to understand and is how
 it operates internally.
 The 
\family typewriter
ALL
\family default
 string really is just for display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data cube of 3D data

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One key demand of OLAP applications is that queries be answered quickly.
 This is of course not a demand that is unique to OLAP: it's very rare that
 it's a requirement for a database or any other software to respond slowly.
 But OLAP's requirements are fairly stringent.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Fortunately, the multidimensional data model of OLAP is structured enough
 to allow this key demand to be approached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is one key property to OLAP or multidimensional data analysis,
 then it is the ability to simultaneously aggregate across many dimensions.
 As we've discussed before (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:OLAP:data-cube:operator"

\end_inset

) and observed in full detail (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:OLAP:data-cube:elaborate-example"

\end_inset

), this translates to many simultaneous 
\family typewriter
GROUP BY
\family default
 statements in SQL, which can result in a performance bottleneck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More efficient schemes to perform these calculations have been researched
 by the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cubing Algorithms"

\end_inset

, amongst others.
 Initially, they have focused on efficient algorithms to compute the cube
 operator, using the standard RDMBS techniques of sorting and hashing.
 As always, precomputing frequently used data can be used to speed up computer
 programs.
 In terms of multidimensional data analysis, aggregates on some subsets
 of dimensions can be precomputed.
 However, it's impossible to precompute everything, and we may end up precomputi
ng unneeded aggregates.
 And because of the hierarchical nature (i.e.
 one subset of dimensions may be a subset of another subset), it's possible
 that the increase in required storage space may be unreasonable.
\end_layout

 are related to each other.
 Then, one can exploit these relationships to minimize the number of calculation

 I/O.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 suggests an approach based on a hierarchical structure.
 They explore a class of sorting-based methods that attempt to minimize
 the number sorting steps by overlapping the computations of the various

 This approach

\begin_layout Standard
The more aggregates that are precomputed, the faster queries can be answered.
 However, it's difficult to say in advance how much space (storage) will
 be required for a certain amount of precomputation.
 There are different methods (discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) to estimate this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is assumed that the data is 
\emph on
uniformly distributed
\emph default
.
 This assumption allows for a mathematical approximation of the number of
 tuples that will appear in the result of the cube computation.
 This is simple statistics:

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This can then be used to calculate the upper bound on the size of the cube.
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the product of the distinct number of values of all attributes on which
 is being grouped (i.e.
 the number of all possible different combinations of values) and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the number of tuples in the relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second method uses a simple 
\emph on
sampling-based
\emph default
 algorithm: take a random subset of the table, compute the cube on that
 subset.
 Then estimate the size of the actual cube by linearly scaling the size
 of the cube of the sample by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{data\, size}{sample\, size}$
\end_inset

 ratio.
 Clearly, if the random sample is biased, then our estimate will be skewed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The potential advantage over the first method (based on the uniform distribution
 assumption) is that this method examines a statistical subset, instead
 of just relying on cardinalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
While the first two methods are simple applications of well-known statistics
 methods, the third tries to exploit the nature of the process that is being
 applied — essentially, data is being grouped according to the distinct
 values within the dimensions.
 This method therefore estimates the number of tuples in each grouping by
 estimating the number of distinct values in each particular grouping.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A suitable 
\emph on
probabilistic 
\emph default
algorithm is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Probabilistic Counting Algos for DB apps"

\end_inset

: it counts the number of distinct values in a multi-set, and makes the
 estimate after a single pass through the database, using only a fixed amount
 of memory.
 Hence this algorithm is a good starting point (single pass and fixed amount
 of memory are very desirable properties).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing these three methods, the first method only works well when
 the data is approximately uniformly distributed (unsurprisingly), the sampling-
based method is strongly dependent on the number of duplicates, and the
 probabilistic method performs very well under various degrees of skew.
 Hence the latter provides the most reliable, accurate and predictable estimate
 of the three considered algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Impact of the Data Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While OLAP is the 'container term', there are actually many variants; including
 ROLAP (relational OLAP) and MOLAP (multidimensional OLAP).
 MOLAP stores the data in an optimized multidimensional array, whereas ROLAP
 stores the data in a relational database.
 Both have their advantages and disadvantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A noteworthy remark: in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cubing Algorithms"

\end_inset

, they found that it was surprisingly efficient to take the data set from
 a table in a relational database, convert this into a multidimensional
 array, 
\emph on
cube
\emph default
 the array and store it back in a database — this has been found to be more
 efficient than cubing the table directly!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, there's much more to the cube operator than meets the eye: a straightfo
rward implementation is likely unable to attain the desired performance;
 optimizations on multiple levels are necessary.
 Precomputing parts seems an obvious optimization, but may require too much
 storage; estimating how much storage this will require is also not trivial.
 The data structures used should be carefully selected, since the performance
 impact can be tremendous.
 And, while complex, attempts to minimize overlapping computations can also
 help significantly.

Performance for range-sum queries and updates

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many applications (businesses), batch updates that are executed overnight
 are sufficient.
 However, in many cases, it is a necessity to have more frequent updates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For decision support and stock trading applications, instantaneous updates
 are crucial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OLAP implies 
\emph on

 Interactivity requires fast updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Batch updates may have a low 
\emph on
average
\emph default
 cost per update, but performing the complete batch may take a considerable
 amount of time.
 For companies that can shut down every night, this might not be a problem,
 but for multinational companies, this poses a problem: at all times, access
 to the data is required somewhere around the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the ability to perform more frequent updates would enable other types
 of applications.
 As a side-effect, applications that don't really need it automatically
 get greater flexibility and 24 hour availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discussed techniques
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the remainder of this section, three techniques are discussed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prefix Sum: this is an example of a technique that allows for fast range-sum
 queries that unfortunately can have very slow updates.
 It is very trivial, anybody with basic math skills could come up with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Relative Prefix Sum: this method is essentially the same as Prefix Sum,
 but stores its data in a smarter manner, to speed up updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dynamic Data Cube: the third and last method is slightly inspired by (Relative)
 Prefix Sum but has as goal to have sub-linear performance, both for queries
 and updates! It is also far more efficient storage-wise: empty regions
 simply are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 stored at all, whereas they would need to be created for the Prefix Sum
 and Relative Prefix Sum methods.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It achieves all this by using a hierarchical (tree) structure, with each
 deeper level accessing more granular data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All are applicable only to range-sum queries, which is a specific type of
 query, but a very common one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, all of the techniques below rely on precomputation and therefore
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:OLAP:data-cube:storage-explosion"

\end_inset

 should be kept into account as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Prefix Sum
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:OLAP:data-cube:updates:prefix-sum"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essential idea of the Prefix Sum method is to precompute many prefix
 sums of the data cube, which can then be used to answer any range-sum query
 in constant time.
 The downside is a large update cost — in the worst case, an array needs
 to be rebuilt that has the same size as the data cube itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could describe the prefix array by the following (very simple) formula,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 the prefix array and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the original array:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
P[i,j]=\sum_{0\leq k\leq i;\,0\leq l\leq j}A[k,l]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the nature of a prefix sum, particular updates have the potential
 to cause enormous cascading updates.
 This becomes instantly obvious when shown the data that the Prefix Sum
 method stores.
 Therefore, an example has been included: please see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:prefix-sum-example"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, when cell 
\begin_inset Formula $A[1,3]$
\end_inset

 would be modified, almost entire 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 would need recalculating.

\begin_layout Standard
This method provides constant time queries with reduced update complexity
 (when compared to the Prefix Sum technique explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 on which it builds).
 Therefore this method is more suitable for applications where constant
 time queries are a necessity but updates are more frequent than the Prefix
 Sum method allows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essence of the Relative Prefix Sum approach is to limit the cascading
 updates that result in poor update performance.
 It achieves this by partitioning the array that is to be updated into fixed
 size regions called 
\emph on
overlay boxes
\emph default
, these are of equal size: 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 in each dimension.
 Thus each overlay box contains

 cells, with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 the number of dimensions.

Combining the overlay array and relative-prefix arrays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By combining the information in both components (
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

), prefix sums can be constructed on the fly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This too, can be made more clear through the use of figures.
 First look again at the right-hand side of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:prefix-sum-example"

\end_inset

.
 Then look at figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:relative-prefix-sum-example"

\end_inset

, which contains an example of the 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 components for figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:prefix-sum-example"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is clear that each cell in the array on the right-hand side of figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:prefix-sum-example"

\end_inset

 can be calculated from the 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 components by adding the corresponding values stored in the 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

To calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $SUM(A[0,0]:A[8,7])$
\end_inset

, we must add 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[6,6]$
\end_inset

 (the anchor cell), 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[8,6]$
\end_inset

 (because our target cell is in column 8 and the anchor cell was in column
 6, we need the value in the overlay array for column 8 as well), 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[6,7]$
\end_inset

 (analogously to the explanation for 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[8,6]$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Update performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the Relative Prefix Sum method is to reduce the amount of update
 cascade.
 Now that has been demonstrated how this method works, it is time to look
 at the update performance.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $A[1,5]$
\end_inset

 is updated from the value 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 to the value 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 contains the sums of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preceding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 regions, all values to the right and those in the first row below need
 to be updated.
 In the running example, these are cells 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[3,5]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[6,5]$
\end_inset

 to the right and cells 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[1,6]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[2,6]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $OL[3.6]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $OL6,6]$
\end_inset

 in the row below.
 This is demonstrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:relative-prefix-sum-update-example"

\end_inset

.
 And since the 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 contains relative prefix sums only for cells within the same overlay box,
 only cells 
\begin_inset Formula $RP[1,5]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RP[2,5]$
\end_inset

 need to be updated (again, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
Discussing all details would again lead us to far, for a detailed analysis
 it is recommended to read 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, but here it suffices to say that in the worst case, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\frac{n}{k}+k-2)^{d}$
\end_inset

 cells need to be updated (with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 the dimensionality, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the number of possible attribute values and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the length of the overlay box in each dimension).
 The worst case update cost has been limited to 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{\frac{d}{2}})$
\end_inset

, which is significantly less than for the Prefix Sum method, since the
 exponent is only half as large (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:OLAP:data-cube:updates:prefix-sum"

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Dynamic Data Cube
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the Relative Prefix Sum method, this method also uses overlay boxes.
 But it uses multiple levels of overlay boxes, arranged in a hierarchy (more
 specifically: a tree structure).
 Through this particular structure (that will be explained more in-depth
 later on), the Dynamic Data Cube method is able to provide sub-linear performan
ce (
\begin_inset Formula $O(\log^{d}n)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 again the dimensionality) for both range sum queries and updates on the
 data cube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Overlay Boxes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overlay boxes are similar to the ones used in the Relative Prefix Sum
 method, but they differ in the values they store, and in the number of
 overlay boxes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values that they store can best be explained through the help of a figure:
 see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:ddc-partitioning"

\end_inset

.
 Each box stores — just like the Relative Prefix Sum method — 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{d}-(k-1)^{d}$
\end_inset

 values (i.e.
 the leaf level stores 1 value, the level above that stores 
\begin_inset Formula $4-1=3$
\end_inset

 values, etc.); these values provide sums of regions 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 the overlay box.
 E.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 contains the sum of all the values of that row.
 Also, because sums of regions within the overlay box are stored, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 includes the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},$
\end_inset

 etc.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the cell that contains the subtotal for that overlay box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, each overlay box is 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 from the other ones at the same level in the hierarchy.
 This is different from the Relative Prefix Sum method, where each overlay
 box also contains the values for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preceding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 regions.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This also explains why the Dynamic Data Cube method uses the bottom row
 and rightmost column: it contains the subtotal for each region.
 Whereas the Relative Prefix Sum method uses the top row and leftmost column
 to store totals for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preceding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 regions in its overlay arrays and then uses the relative-prefix array to
 be able to calculate the other cells in that overlay box.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated before, overlay boxes are organized in a tree structure that recursive
ly partitions the array.
 This tree structure is the reason that the number of overlay boxes differs
 from that of the Relative Prefix Sum method.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The root node of the tree contains the complete range of the array, in overlay
 boxes of size 
\begin_inset Formula $k=\frac{n}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Each overlay box is again divided in half (so now 
\begin_inset Formula $k=\frac{n}{4}$
\end_inset

), and so on.
 This recursive partitioning continues until the leaf level, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 and each overlay box contains a single cell.
 At that point, the leaf level contains the values stored in the original
 array.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For a graphical explanation, see the three different levels, from root to
 leaf level, as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:ddc-levels"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the overlay boxes are stored in special structures, sub-linear query
 and update times can be guaranteed.
 For two-dimensional overlays (
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

), overlay boxes are not stored in arrays, but in a specialized hierarchical
 structure with an access and update cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\log n)$
\end_inset

; for details on that see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dynamic Data Cube - specialized hierarchical structure"

\end_inset

.
 When the data cubes have a higher dimension (
\begin_inset Formula $d>2$
\end_inset

), the overlay box values of a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional data cube can be stored as 
\begin_inset Formula $(d-1)$
\end_inset

-dimensional data cubes in a recursive manner
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The surfaces containing the overlay values of a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional overlay box are 
\begin_inset Formula $(d-1)$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $d=2$

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Queries & Updates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range sum for any query can be calculated by retrieving only overlay
 box values.
 The query begins at the root node of the tree and includes every overlay
 box that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covered in every dimension
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the coordinates of the cell whose range sum we're calculating (i.e.
 if that cell's index is greater than or equal to the overlay box' index
 in every dimension), i.e.
 the included overlay boxes contribute their subtotals to the sum.
 If the cell intersects the overlay box, then the box contributes the correspond
ing overlay value (a row sum value in a 2D data cube, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:ddc-partitioning"

\end_inset

).
 Then, we go to a deeper level in the tree until we reach the leaf level.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Since overlay boxes at the same tree level do not intersect, at most one
 child will be traversed down.
 The same algorithm is applied again.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thanks to this recursive nature, less values need to be retrieved, resulting
 in an overall query cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\log^{d}n)$
\end_inset

 — for details see again 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dynamic Data Cube - specialized hierarchical structure"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The same descent down the tree must be made when performing an update instead
 of a request, resulting in a worst case update cost that is identical to
 the overall query cost.
 Again, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dynamic Data Cube - specialized hierarchical structure"

\end_inset

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dynamic Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither the Prefix Sum nor the Relative Prefix Sum methods carry optimizations
 to limit growth of the data cube.
 Instead, they assume that the size of each dimension is known a priori,
 or simply that size is not an issue.
 For some cases, it's more convenient (and space efficient) to grow the
 size of the data cube dynamically, just enough to suit the size of the
 data.
 For example, the number of possible values of an attribute could be large,
 but the number of 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 different values that are taken is low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Prefix Sum and Relative Prefix Sum methods would need to grow new rows
 (for lack of a better term in >3D; more accurately: expansion in a specific
 dimension) for even a single cell in a previously non-existing area — see
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:OLAP:data-cube:ddc-growth"

\end_inset

 for an example.
 The Dynamic Data Cube, on the other hand, could just grow into the required
 direction, affecting just one overlay box at each tree level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes the Dynamic Data Cube a natural fit for data that contains large
 non-populated regions: where there is no data, the overlay boxes will simply
 not be created.
 In other words: the Dynamic Data Cube 
\emph on
avoids the storage of empty regions
\emph default
, unlike the Prefix Sum and Relative Prefix Sum methods.
